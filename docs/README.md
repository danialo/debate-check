## 📋 Features

### Core Claim Detection
Identifies and categorizes different types of claims:

- **Factual Claims**: Objective statements that can be verified
- **Statistical Claims**: Numerical data and percentages  
- **Causal Claims**: Cause-and-effect relationships
- **Comparative Claims**: Comparisons between entities
- **Historical Claims**: References to past events

#### Confidence Scoring
Each claim is assigned a confidence score (0.0-1.0) based on linguistic patterns:
- **High (0.7-1.0)**: Strong factual statements with clear markers
- **Medium (0.5-0.7)**: Reasonable claims with some uncertainty
- **Low (0.3-0.5)**: Ambiguous or uncertain statements
Detailed documentation on confidence scoring is available in [docs/confidence_scoring.md](docs/confidence_scoring.md).

### 🆕 YouTube/Podcast Transcript Processing
- **Smart Chunking**: Intelligently breaks long transcripts into logical segments
- **Speaker Inference**: Identifies speakers using name mentions and linguistic patterns
- **Claim Clustering**: Groups related claims by topic and argumentative stance
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains claim context across transcript segments

### ✨ **NEW**: Fact-Checking Integration
- **Multi-Service Verification**: Integrates Google Fact Check Tools API, Wikipedia, and local database
- **Credibility Scoring**: Assigns verification scores and confidence ratings to claims
- **Source Attribution**: Links verified claims to credible fact-checking sources
- **Aggregated Results**: Combines multiple verification sources for comprehensive scoring

### 🔥 **NEW**: Logical Fallacy Detection
- **5 Core Fallacy Types**: Detects Ad Hominem, Straw Man, False Dilemma, Appeal to Authority, and Slippery Slope
- **Pattern Recognition**: Uses advanced regex patterns and linguistic analysis
- **Confidence Scoring**: Assigns confidence levels (High/Medium/Low) based on pattern strength
- **Contextual Analysis**: Links fallacies to specific claims and speakers
- **Severity Assessment**: Rates fallacy severity and provides explanations

### 🚀 **NEW**: Full Analysis Mode
- **Combined Pipeline**: Single command runs both fact-checking and fallacy detection
- **Comprehensive Results**: Unified output with verification scores and fallacy identification
- **Cross-Referenced Analysis**: Links fact-check results with detected logical fallacies

### 🚦 **NEW**: Sophisticated Claim Filtering System
**(⚠️ Active Development - Testing in Progress)**

Comprehensive filtering system that removes non-claims and improves analysis quality:

#### 12 Specialized Filters
- **ConversationalFilter**: Removes fillers ("yeah", "right", "mhm", etc.) and topic introductions
- **QuestionFilter**: Excludes direct questions and interrogative patterns
- **HypotheticalFilter**: Filters scenarios, examples, and "suppose" statements
- **SponsorContentFilter**: Removes promotional content and advertisements
- **MetadataFilter**: Excludes titles, labels, and rhetorical questions
- **MinimumContentFilter**: Ensures substantive content with anchor points
- **ShowIntroPleasantryFilter**: Removes show intros/outros and pleasantries
- **BiographicalFilter**: Filters first-person anecdotes not suitable for fact-checking
- **TruncationFragmentFilter**: Removes truncated and incomplete text fragments
- **PronounVaguenessFilter**: Filters vague pronoun references without concrete content
- **DiscourseFragmentFilter**: Handles complex discourse patterns and conversational noise
- **MangledTextFilter**: Detects and removes corrupted or concatenated text

#### Claim Classification
- **Philosophical vs. Empirical**: Automatically distinguishes normative/philosophical claims from factual ones
- **Selective Fact-Checking**: Only fact-checks empirical claims, skips philosophical positions
- **Smart Routing**: Philosophical claims bypass Wikipedia searches for efficiency

#### Quantified Results
```
Free Will Debate Analysis (Sample):
• Original Pipeline:  75 claims (many false positives)
• Enhanced Pipeline:  49 claims (high-quality, properly classified)
• Improvement:        35% reduction in non-claims
• Fact-checking:      71% fewer inappropriate fact-checks
```

> **Development Status**: The filtering system is implemented with 12 specialized filters but requires additional testing and validation. Some filtering tests are currently being debugged and refined.

### Example 2: Quick Test with Simple Input
```bash
python -m debate_claim_extractor --input test_input.txt
```

This processes the short test file and displays results directly in the terminal.

### Example 3: Process from Standard Input (Pipe)
```bash
echo "SPEAKER A: Unemployment decreased by 15% last year. SPEAKER B: That's false - it only decreased by 8% according to BLS data." | python -m debate_claim_extractor
```

### Example 4: Verbose Mode for Debugging
```bash
python -m debate_claim_extractor --input sample_transcript.txt --verbose
```

This shows detailed processing information including:
- Speaker identification
- Sentence segmentation counts
- Claim detection by type
- Post-processing steps

### Example 4b: 🔥 **NEW**: Fact-Checking with Local Database
```bash
python -m debate_claim_extractor --input sample_transcript.txt --fact-check --verbose
```

This enables fact-checking using the built-in local database, which includes:
- Pre-verified claims about vaccines, climate change, unemployment data
- Automatic similarity matching to find related fact-checks
- Verification scores and source attribution

### Example 4c: 🔥 **NEW**: Fact-Checking with Google API
```bash
# Set the Google Fact Check Tools API key
export GOOGLE_FACT_CHECK_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Run with both Google API and local database
python -m debate_claim_extractor --input sample_transcript.txt --fact-check --google-api-key $GOOGLE_FACT_CHECK_API_KEY --verbose
```

This enables comprehensive fact-checking using:
- Google Fact Check Tools API for professional fact-checkers
- Local database for common claims
- Aggregated verification scores from multiple sources

### Example 5: 🔥 **NEW**: Logical Fallacy Detection
```bash
python -m debate_claim_extractor --input sample_transcript.txt --fallacy-detection --verbose
```

- **Ad Hominem**: Personal attacks instead of addressing arguments
- **Straw Man**: Misrepresenting opponent's position
- **False Dilemma**: Presenting only two options when more exist
- **Appeal to Authority**: Inappropriate appeals to vague or irrelevant authorities
- **Slippery Slope**: Claiming one event will lead to extreme consequences

### Example 6: 🚀 **NEW**: Full Analysis Mode (Fact-Checking + Fallacy Detection)
```bash
# Complete analysis with both fact-checking and fallacy detection
python -m debate_claim_extractor --input sample_transcript.txt --full-analysis --verbose

# Alternative: Enable both features explicitly
python -m debate_claim_extractor --input sample_transcript.txt --fact-check --fallacy-detection --verbose
```

This comprehensive analysis provides:
- **Claim extraction** with confidence scoring
- **Fact verification** using multiple sources (Wikipedia, local database, Google API if available)
- **Fallacy detection** with pattern matching and severity assessment
- **Cross-referenced results** linking claims to verification status and detected fallacies

### Example 7: 🆕 YouTube/Long Transcript Processing
```bash
# Test with the enhanced YouTube pipeline
cd /path/to/debate-check
source venv/bin/activate
python test_youtube_pipeline.py
```

For long transcripts (>2000 characters), the system automatically:
- **Chunks intelligently** at natural conversation boundaries
- **Infers speakers** using name mentions and linguistic patterns
- **Clusters related claims** by topic and stance
- **Preserves context** across chunks

**Sample YouTube Pipeline Output:**
```json
{
  "claims": [...],
  "youtube_enhanced": true,
  "chunks_used": true,
  "chunk_analysis": {
    "total_chunks": 9,
    "avg_chunk_size": 1454,
    "speaker_inference": {
      "CHARLES": 2,
      "NEIL": 3,
      "SPEAKER_A": 3,
      "SPEAKER_B": 1
    }
  },
  "clusters": [
    {
      "id": "cluster_0",
      "type": "causal",
      "stance": "neutral", 
      "claims_count": 8,
      "topics": ["choice", "psychology", "philosophy"],
      "primary_claim": {
        "text": "Representative claim from cluster",
        "confidence": 0.65
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example 8: 🎯 **NEW**: Multi-Dimensional Scoring System
```bash
# Enable scoring for comprehensive debate quality analysis
python -m debate_claim_extractor --input sample_transcript.txt --enable-scoring --verbose

# Or use comprehensive analysis (includes all features + scoring)
python -m debate_claim_extractor --input sample_transcript.txt --comprehensive-analysis --verbose
```

The scoring system provides advanced analytical metrics across four dimensions:

#### 🧠 **Core Scoring Metrics**
- **Information Quality** (0.0-1.0): Combines claim confidence with fact-checking verification boosts
- **Logical Consistency** (0.0-1.0): Inverse relationship to fallacy frequency, weighted by severity
- **Factual Accuracy** (0.0-1.0): Weighted average of verification results from multiple sources
- **Engagement Quality** (0.0-1.0): Measures diversity, speaker balance, and complexity minus fallacy penalties

#### 👥 **Speaker Performance Analysis**
- **Individual credibility scores** for each debate participant
- **Claim accuracy tracking** based on fact-checking results
- **Fallacy penalty calculation** weighted by severity (High/Medium/Low)
- **Performance distributions** across claim types and verification statuses

#### ⚖️ **Argument Strength Evaluation**
- **Evidence scoring** based on fact-checking verification strength
- **Logic scoring** (inverse fallacy penalty with severity weighting)
- **Relevance scoring** based on claim type and confidence characteristics
- **Clarity scoring** optimized for claim length and structural complexity

### Claim Types Explained
- **Statistical**: Claims with numbers, percentages, data ("GDP grew by 3.2%")
- **Causal**: Cause-and-effect statements ("because", "due to", "leads to")
- **Comparative**: Comparisons between entities ("better than", "more effective")
- **Historical**: References to past events ("In 2019", "since 1995")
- **Factual**: General assertions and statements

## 🎯 Input Format Requirements

### Supported Transcript Formats
The system works best with these speaker formats:

**Standard Format:**
```
SPEAKER NAME: Their statement here.
ANOTHER SPEAKER: Their response.
```

**Variations Supported:**
```
MODERATOR: Question here.
CANDIDATE A: Answer here.
CANDIDATE SMITH: Another answer.
[JONES]: Statement in brackets.
(INTERVIEWER): Statement in parentheses.
```

### 🆕 YouTube/Podcast Transcript Format
**NEW**: The system now handles **long transcripts without speaker labels**!

**YouTube Auto-Transcript Format (Supported):**
```
Charles I want to compare notes okay on free will oh one of my favorite things here's my take it is true that at some level of resolution that we can observe causality is absolutely true given these initial conditions this is what will happen afterwards that's the physicist speaking so if you take it to its logical conclusion then there is no free will because everything is predetermined...
```

The enhanced pipeline automatically:
- ✅ **Chunks** long text into conversation segments
- ✅ **Infers speakers** from name mentions ("Neil", "Charles")
- ✅ **Maintains context** across segments
- ✅ **Groups related claims** into clusters

### Tips for Best Results
1. **Standard Transcripts**: Use consistent `SPEAKER:` format when available
2. **YouTube Transcripts**: System handles continuous text automatically
3. **Complete Sentences**: The system works better with full sentences
4. **Remove Timestamps**: The preprocessor handles basic cleanup
5. **Stage Directions**: Basic stage directions like `(applause)` are automatically removed

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue: "Command not found"**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the right directory and virtual environment is activated
cd /path/to/debate-check
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Issue: "spaCy model not found" warnings**
This is normal! The system falls back to rule-based processing which works well:
```
WARNING: spaCy English model not found. Install with: python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

To install spaCy model (optional enhancement):
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

**Issue: No claims detected**
- Check that the input has clear speaker labels (`SPEAKER:`)
- Try with `--verbose` to see processing details
- Ensure sentences contain factual assertions, not just questions

### Checking Processing Details
Use verbose mode to understand what's happening:
```bash
python -m debate_claim_extractor --input file.txt --verbose
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Pipe to jq for better JSON viewing** (if installed):
   ```bash
   python -m debate_claim_extractor --input sample_transcript.txt | jq '.'
   ```

2. **Extract just the claims text**:
   ```bash
   python -m debate_claim_extractor --input sample_transcript.txt | jq -r '.claims[].text'
   ```

3. **Count claims by speaker**:
   ```bash
   python -m debate_claim_extractor --input sample_transcript.txt | jq '.claims | group_by(.speaker) | .[] | {speaker: .[0].speaker, count: length}'
   ```

4. **Filter high-confidence claims**:
   ```bash
   python -m debate_claim_extractor --input sample_transcript.txt | jq '.claims[] | select(.confidence > 0.6)'
   ```

5. **🔥 Extract detected fallacies only**:
   ```bash
   python -m debate_claim_extractor --input sample_transcript.txt --fallacy-detection | jq '.fallacies[]'
   ```

6. **🔥 Show fact-check verification status summary**:
   ```bash
   python -m debate_claim_extractor --input sample_transcript.txt --fact-check | jq '.meta.verification_summary'
   ```

7. **🚀 Run full analysis and extract only high-severity fallacies**:
   ```bash
   python -m debate_claim_extractor --input sample_transcript.txt --full-analysis | jq '.fallacies[] | select(.severity == "high")'
   ```

8. **🚀 Show fact-checked claims with their verification status**:
   ```bash
   python -m debate_claim_extractor --input sample_transcript.txt --fact-check | jq '.claims[] | {text: .text, verification: .fact_check_result.status, confidence: .fact_check_result.confidence}'
   ```
