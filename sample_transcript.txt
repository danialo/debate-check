MODERATOR: Good evening, and welcome to tonight's debate on healthcare policy. Let's start with the first question about healthcare costs.

CANDIDATE A: Thank you, moderator. Healthcare costs have risen by 25% over the past five years, which is simply unsustainable. My plan will reduce costs because it eliminates the middleman insurance companies that add unnecessary overhead.

CANDIDATE B: That's not accurate. Healthcare costs increased by only 18% according to the latest CBO report. Moreover, my opponent's plan will actually increase costs due to higher taxes needed to fund the system.

MODERATOR: Can you provide more details about your specific proposals?

CANDIDATE A: Certainly. In 2019, we implemented a similar program in my home state, and it worked effectively. The program covered 95% of residents and reduced emergency room visits by 30%.

CANDIDATE B: But that state program was smaller and less complex than what's being proposed nationally. Historically, federal healthcare programs have exceeded budget projections. Medicare, for example, cost three times more than originally estimated when it was created in 1965.

CANDIDATE A: (interruption) That's a misleading comparison because medical technology has advanced significantly since 1965.

MODERATOR: Please let Candidate B finish their point.

CANDIDATE B: Thank you. What I was saying is that government-run healthcare leads to longer wait times and worse outcomes compared to private systems. Countries with socialized medicine have consistently lower patient satisfaction rates.

CANDIDATE A: That's simply false. Studies show that patient satisfaction is higher in countries with universal healthcare systems. Canada, for instance, has better health outcomes than the United States across most major metrics.
